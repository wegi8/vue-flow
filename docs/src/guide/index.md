## What is Vue Flow?

Vue Flow is a Vue 3 library that brings interactivity to flowcharts and graphs.

It is a tool to build your own diagrams, editors and whatever your imagination allows for.

Easily implement your own custom nodes and edges and expand on the basic functionality and on top of that Vue Flow comes
with a couple of additional components like a Background, a Minimap and Controls.

Check out the [examples](/examples/) if you want to dive directly into the code.
