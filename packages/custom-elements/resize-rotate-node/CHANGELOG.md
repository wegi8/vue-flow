### Major Changes

- [#305](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu/vue-flow/pull/305) [`939bff50`](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu/vue-flow/commit/939bff503039af3b790160640548ddde984cf2bc) Thanks [@bcakmakoglu](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu)! - # What's changed?

  - Simplify edge path calculations
    - remove `getEdgeCenter` and `getSimpleEdgeCenter`

  # Breaking Changes

  - `getEdgeCenter` has been removed
    - Edge center positions can now be accessed from `getBezierPath` or `getSmoothStepPath` functions

  Before:

  ```js
  import { getBezierPath, getEdgeCenter } from '@braks/vue-flow'

  // used to return the path string only
  const edgePath = computed(() => getBezierPath(pathParams))

  // was necessary to get the centerX, centerY of an edge
  const centered = computed(() => getEdgeCenter(centerParams))
  ```

  After:

  ```js
  import { getBezierPath } from '@vue-flow/core'

  // returns the path string and the center positions
  const [path, centerX, centerY] = computed(() => getBezierPath(pathParams))
  ```

  - Change pkg scope from 'braks' to 'vue-flow'
    - Add `@vue-flow/core` package
    - Add `@vue-flow/additional-components` package
    - Add `@vue-flow/pathfinding-edge` package
    - Add `@vue-flow/resize-rotate-node` package

  # Features

  - `useNode` and `useEdge` composables
    - can be used to access current node/edge (or by id) and their respective element refs (if used inside the elements' context, i.e. a custom node/edge)
  - `selectionKeyCode` as `true`
    - allows for figma style selection (i.e. create a selection rect without holding shift or any other key)
  - Handles to trigger handle bounds calculation on mount
    - if no handle bounds are found, a Handle will try to calculate its bounds on mount
    - should remove the need for `updateNodeInternals` on dynamic handles
  - Testing for various features using Cypress 10

  # Bugfixes

  - Fix `removeSelectedEdges` and `removeSelectedNodes` actions not properly removing elements from store

  # Breaking Changes

  - `@vue-flow/core` package is now required to use vue-flow
  - `@vue-flow/additional-components` package contains `Background`, `MiniMap` and `Controls` components and related types
    - When switching to the new pkg scope, you need to change the import path.

  Before:

  ```js
  import { VueFlow, Background, MiniMap, Controls } from '@braks/vue-flow'
  ```

  After

  ```js
  import { VueFlow } from '@vue-flow/core'
  import { Background, MiniMap, Controls } from '@vue-flow/additional-components'
  ```
